# Reactagram

## This application was an instagram clone using React, GraphQL, and Pusher.

## This app was being built based off a tutorial/guide including all the technologies listed above. I never had experience using GraphQL and pusher so I thought it was great opportunity to learn them while building an app that I have built before using different frameworks and libraries.

## The tutorial stated it was beginner friendly but I came to the conclusion it wasn't, so I will longer be working on this app.
